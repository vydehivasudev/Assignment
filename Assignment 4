2.Logs and Observations

### Voting Pod Deletion

- Command: `kubectl delete pod <voting-pod-name>`
- Observation: Voting functionality stopped temporarily until the pod was recreated.

### Worker Pod Deletion

- Command: `kubectl delete pod <worker-pod-name>`
- Observation: No immediate visible effect on the apps.

### DB Pod Deletion

- Command: `kubectl delete pod <db-pod-name>`
- Observation: The result app stopped updating and showed an error as it couldn't connect to the
  database.

3.Why Result App Stopped Working

The result app stopped working after the DB pod was deleted because it lost connection to the database, 
which stores the voting results.

4.How to Make the Result Pod Work Again

To make the result pod work again, I ensured that the DB pod was up and running. Once the database 
was available, the result pod automatically reconnected to it and resumed displaying results.
