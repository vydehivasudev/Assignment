A common use-case for using a DaemonSet instead of a ReplicaSet in Kubernetes is when you need to ensure 
that a particular pod runs on all nodes within the cluster.

1.Log Collection
Scenario: You want to collect logs from all nodes in the cluster.

Explanation: To ensure that logs are collected from all nodes, you deploy a log collection agent 
(such as Fluentd, Filebeat, or Logstash) using a DaemonSet.
This ensures that each node has the log collector running, thereby collecting logs from all nodes.

2.Node Monitoring
Scenario: You want to monitor the health and performance of all nodes in the cluster.

Explanation: To monitor node health and performance, you deploy a monitoring agent (such as Prometheus
Node Exporter or Datadog Agent) using a DaemonSet. This ensures that each node has a monitoring agent 
running, thereby collecting metrics from all nodes.
