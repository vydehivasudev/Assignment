To update a container's image using a Deployment in Kubernetes, ensuring zero downtime, you can follow 
these steps:

1.Update the Deployment manifest with the new image version.
2.Apply the updated manifest using kubectl apply -f my-deployment.yaml.
3.Ensure the RollingUpdate strategy is set in the Deployment.
4.Monitor the update process with kubectl rollout status deployment/my-app.
5.Verify the update by checking the running pods.
6.Rollback if necessary using kubectl rollout undo deployment/my-app.

Following these steps ensures that your application is updated with zero downtime, leveraging
Kubernetes' rolling update mechanism.
